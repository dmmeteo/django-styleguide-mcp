## How to ask a question or propose something?

Few points to navigate yourself:

1. If you've read the Django Styleguide & you have questions or suggestions, **the simplest thing you can is to open an issue.** We will respond.
1. Even if you have a question that you are not sure if it's related to the Django Styleguide - **just open an issue anyway.** We will respond.
1. **If you want to see a code example**, make sure to head to the [Django Styleguide Example](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide-Example) repository. We treat this as a "Django test project", combining best practices & also [examples from our blog](https://www.hacksoft.io/blog).

That's about it âœ¨
