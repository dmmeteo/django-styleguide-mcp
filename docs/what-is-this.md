## What is this?

Hello ðŸ‘‹

This is the Django Styleguide, created by us, the folks at [HackSoft](https://hacksoft.io).

**Few important notes about it:**

1. It's derived from many years of experience & many Django projects, both big & small.
1. It's pragmatic. All things mentioned here are things tested in production.
1. It's opinionated. This is how we build applications with Django.
1. It's not the only way. There are other ways of building & structuring Django projects that can do the job for you.
1. We have a [`Django-Styleguide-Example`](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide-Example) to show most of the styleguide in an actual project.

**You can watch Radoslav Georgiev's [Django structure for scale and longevity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG3ZdxBb1oo) for the philosophy behind the styleguide:**
