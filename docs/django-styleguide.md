## Django Styleguide in the Wild

Here's a collection of different folks & companies, that have found the styleguide useful:

---

**Michael Valencia, CTO at [Facturedo](https://facturedo.com/)**

> The source code of our core project in Facturedo started to get messy.
> Business logic could be found in many, incoherent places. We needed a solution to structure our Django project and we found it in the Django Styleguide.
>
> We recommend it to anyone wanting to structure a medium to large-sized project.
> It's a well defined guide that's constantly evolving.
