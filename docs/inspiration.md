## Inspiration

The way we do Django is inspired by the following things:

- The general idea for **separation of concerns**
- [Boundaries by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkzNHF6rMs)
- Rails service objects
- Recently, I saw the [Cognitive Load is what matters](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load) article and it resonated with me. Some of the things mentioned there are also a key concept of the Django Styleguide.
