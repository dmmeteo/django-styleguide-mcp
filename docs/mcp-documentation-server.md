### MCP Documentation Server

To enhance the developer experience when working with the Django Styleguide, we provide an MCP (Machine Context Protocol) documentation server that integrates with various IDEs like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude.

This allows you to get contextual help and documentation while working with the Django Styleguide directly in your IDE.

For setup instructions, see [Setting up MCP Documentation Server](tools/setup_mpc.md).
