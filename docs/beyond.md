Celery has powerful tools to implement complex workflows - <https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/canvas.html>

If you decide to use them, the rules still apply.

You may need to reorganize things a bit, but as long as you have a well-defined interface to your application core, you'll be able to mix and match tasks & services in more complex scenarios.

**More complex scenarios depend on their context. Make sure you are aware of the architecture & the decisions you are making.**
