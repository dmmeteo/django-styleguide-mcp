## How to use it?

When it comes to the Django Styleguide, **there are 3 general ways of using it:**

1. Strictly follow everything written here.
2. Cherry-pick whatever makes sense to you, based on your specific context.
3. Don't follow anything written here.

**We recommend point number 2:**

- Read the styleguide.
- Decide what's going to work best for you.
- Adapt for your specific case.
