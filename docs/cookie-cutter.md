## Cookie Cutter

We recommend starting every new project with some kind of cookiecutter. Having the proper structure from the start pays off.

Few examples:

- You can use the [`Styleguide-Example`](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Styleguide-Example) project as a starting point.
- You can also use [`cookiecutter-django`](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) since it has a ton of good stuff inside.
- Or you can create something that works for your case & turn it into a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.
