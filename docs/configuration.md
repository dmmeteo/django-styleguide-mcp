### Configuration

We pretty much follow the official guidelines of integrating Celery with Django - <https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html>

For a full example, you can check the Celery configuration in the `Django-Styleguide-Example` project:

- <https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide-Example/tree/master/styleguide_example/tasks>
- <https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide-Example/blob/master/styleguide_example/tasks/celery.py>

Celery is a complex topic, so it's a good idea to invest time reading the documentation & understanding the different configuration options.

We constantly do that & find new things or find better approaches to our problems.
